/*
The limiter is probably the most advanced effect here
Capable of turning /any/ input into Sosig with minimal distortion, if params are set right
Also eliminates offsets (very helpful for reverb)
Ratio is basically infinity and attack is basically instant
But as long as iters = ~3-8, it won't sound clipped
	(lower lookeahead does produce somewhat of a hi-pass sound)
For a subtler effect, lower speed and/or raise thresh
Latency = lookahead, so use 'wet' if you want parallel compression
If your input only has peaks going upward (like anything involving beat() or synth() ):
	then divide speed by 100 and set bias to 99
	(bias )
'p' changes how lookaheads affect the function:
	0, or very large: lower pitches dominate
	0..1: stacatto and trebly
Hum reduction is only really noticeable when speed > 9 and thresh is low
